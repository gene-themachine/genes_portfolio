# genes_portfolio


This personal portfolio website is simple, with basic colors and design. I've added an about, projects, and activities sections that encapsulates who I am as a person and as a developer. What's cool about this website is that I've added a hamburger menu section where you can navigate the different sections of the page. Try to squeeze the page shorter horizontally, and you'll see what I mean when the menu turns into a hamburger. I've added modern designs by when hovered, some elements will enlarge, giving it a more interactive experience to the user.
