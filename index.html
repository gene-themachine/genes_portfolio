                <p class ="description">Looking back, most of my coding skills were self-taught from online courses. I started my coding journey with AP Computer Science A in high school. I, then, picked up Python and data science thereafter from the University of Helsinki’s MOOC, using it to code the stock screener. Wanting to merge my interest in music, I conducted a statistical test to compare sonic features of songs. After seeing the potential for webs to connect with the users, I started learning web-development starting college from the Odin Project. Although my background is mostly self-taught, it shows my consistency and drive to become a better coder.</p>
